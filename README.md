# C++ Sudoku Solver

A modern C++ Sudoku solver designed with compile-time optimizations, leveraging template metaprogramming and traits-based design. 
I created this solver as a private project to learn how to code in modern C++. This solver can be used for educational purposes.

>I have done this on MacOS Seqouia (15.0) running on Apple Silicon (arm64). Other target environments has not been tested

## Features

- **Compile-Time Optimizations**: Utilizes `constexpr` and template metaprogramming to perform computations at compile time.
- **Traits-Based Design**: Flexible traits system to define board size, value ranges, etc.
- **Doxygen Documentation**: Automatically generated documentation.
- **Modern C++ Practices**: Follows best practices and leverages C++17 features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++17 (or later) compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake (version 3.15 or later)
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) (optional, for building documentation)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) from Microsoft for installation of external packages

#### Install Doxygen
```bash
brew install doxygen
```

#### Install vcpkg

Run this in the ~/Developer directory
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

Install needed dependencies
```bash
brew install pkg-config
```

Add this line to your ~/.zshrc file
```
export PATH="$HOME/vcpkg:$PATH"
```

#### Configure CLion
Set the following CMake option in Settingsâ€”Build,Execution,Deploymentâ€”CMake
 ```
 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path to vcpkg>/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
 ```

### Build Instructions

Clone the repository and from the root of the project you run the following commands
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

To build the documentation, you run
```bash
cmake --build . --target doc
```
Documentation will be generated in the `docs/` directory.

### Run the Solver
```bash
./bin/sudoku_solver
```
